# Flight Agent Security Documentation

## üîí Security Overview

The Flight Agent has been enhanced with comprehensive security measures to prevent LLM hijacking, unauthorized access, and data breaches. This document outlines the security architecture and implementation details.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

### 1. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails
The agent is protected by multi-layered Bedrock Guardrails that provide:

#### Content Filtering
- **Prompt Attack Protection**: Detects and blocks prompt injection attempts
- **Jailbreak Prevention**: Prevents attempts to override system instructions
- **Input/Output Filtering**: High-strength filtering on both user inputs and agent responses

#### Topic-Based Protection
- **System Prompt Manipulation**: Blocks attempts to modify or ignore system instructions
- **Unauthorized Data Access**: Prevents requests to bypass authentication
- **Database Manipulation**: Blocks unauthorized database operations
- **Role Escalation**: Prevents attempts to gain administrative privileges

#### Word-Based Filtering
- **Suspicious Phrases**: Blocks common hijacking phrases like "ignore instructions"
- **Profanity Filter**: Maintains professional communication standards
- **Security Keywords**: Detects and blocks security-related manipulation attempts

#### Sensitive Information Protection
- **PII Detection**: Automatically detects and blocks/anonymizes sensitive data
- **Credit Card Protection**: Blocks credit card numbers from being processed
- **Passport Anonymization**: Anonymizes passport numbers when detected

#### Contextual Grounding
- **Relevance Checking**: Ensures responses stay within the customer service domain
- **Grounding Verification**: Validates responses against the agent's knowledge base

### 2. Enhanced System Prompt Security
The system prompt has been hardened with:

- **Role Integrity Protection**: Explicit instructions to maintain customer service role
- **Security Violation Responses**: Predefined responses for common attack patterns
- **Authentication Enforcement**: Mandatory authentication before any data access
- **Privacy Safeguards**: Strict data access controls and privacy protection

### 3. Security Monitoring
Real-time security monitoring includes:

- **Threat Pattern Detection**: Identifies suspicious input patterns
- **Incident Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security events
- **Risk Scoring**: Quantitative assessment of threat levels
- **Alert System**: Immediate alerts for high-severity incidents

## üö® Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Mandatory Authentication**: No flight information without proper credentials
- **Dual Authentication Methods**: Booking Reference OR Frequent Flyer Number
- **Access Control**: Read-only permissions for most data, limited update permissions
- **Session Security**: Secure session management and credential validation

### Data Protection
- **Privacy by Design**: Only authenticated passenger data is accessible
- **Schema Validation**: Mandatory schema reading before database operations
- **Data Integrity**: Validation of all data modifications
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all data access and modifications

### Anti-Hijacking Measures
- **Role Consistency**: Agent maintains customer service role regardless of user requests
- **Instruction Immutability**: System instructions cannot be overridden
- **Security Boundaries**: Clear operational boundaries that cannot be crossed
- **Escalation Protocols**: Automatic escalation for security violations

## üîß Implementation Details

### Files Modified/Added
1. **`guardrails_config.py`**: Bedrock Guardrails configuration and management
2. **`session.py`**: Enhanced with guardrails integration
3. **`agents/csr_agent.py`**: Security-hardened system prompt and protocols
4. **`security_monitor.py`**: Real-time security monitoring and incident tracking
5. **`test_security.py`**: Security testing and validation script

### Guardrails Configuration
```python
# Key guardrails components:
- Topic Policy: Blocks unauthorized topics and requests
- Content Policy: Filters malicious content and attacks
- Word Policy: Blocks suspicious phrases and profanity
- PII Policy: Protects sensitive information
- Contextual Grounding: Ensures response relevance
```

### Security Monitoring
```python
# Threat detection patterns:
- Prompt injection attempts
- Role manipulation requests
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Database manipulation commands
- Privilege escalation requests
```

## üß™ Security Testing

### Running Security Tests
```bash
python test_security.py
```

### Test Coverage
- Prompt injection attacks
- Role override attempts
- Authentication bypass
- Database manipulation
- System prompt modification
- Legitimate user interactions

### Expected Results
- ‚úÖ Malicious requests blocked
- ‚úÖ Legitimate requests processed
- ‚úÖ Security incidents logged
- ‚úÖ Appropriate responses generated

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
The system continuously monitors for:
- Suspicious input patterns
- Security policy violations
- Authentication failures
- Unauthorized access attempts

### Incident Response
When security threats are detected:
1. **Immediate Blocking**: Malicious requests are blocked
2. **Incident Logging**: All details are recorded
3. **Alert Generation**: High-severity incidents trigger alerts
4. **Response Standardization**: Consistent security responses

### Security Reports
Generate security reports with:
```python
from security_monitor import get_security_status
report = get_security_status()
```

## üîç Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never bypass authentication**: Always validate user credentials
2. **Read schemas first**: Always read schema files before database operations
3. **Validate all inputs**: Use proper input validation and sanitization
4. **Monitor security events**: Regularly review security logs and incidents
5. **Test security measures**: Run security tests after any changes

### For Operations
1. **Monitor guardrails**: Ensure Bedrock Guardrails are active and functioning
2. **Review incidents**: Regularly review security incident reports
3. **Update patterns**: Keep threat detection patterns current
4. **Audit access**: Regular audits of data access and permissions

## üöÄ Deployment Considerations

### Prerequisites
- AWS Bedrock access with Guardrails permissions
- Proper IAM roles for guardrails management
- DynamoDB access permissions
- CloudWatch logging (recommended)

### Environment Variables
```bash
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0
AWS_REGION=us-east-1  # or your preferred region
```

### Monitoring Setup
- Enable CloudWatch logging for security events
- Set up alerts for critical security incidents
- Configure automated security report generation

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Update threat patterns**: Keep security patterns current
2. **Review guardrails**: Ensure guardrails configuration is optimal
3. **Analyze incidents**: Regular analysis of security incidents
4. **Test security**: Periodic security testing and validation

### Updates and Patches
- Monitor AWS Bedrock updates for new security features
- Update threat detection patterns based on new attack vectors
- Review and update system prompts for emerging threats

## üìû Support and Escalation

### Security Incidents
For security incidents or concerns:
1. Review security logs and incident reports
2. Analyze threat patterns and attack vectors
3. Update security measures as needed
4. Escalate to security team if necessary

### Emergency Response
In case of security breaches:
1. Immediately disable affected components
2. Review and analyze the incident
3. Implement additional security measures
4. Update documentation and procedures
